# Transformer From Scratch

## Data
Protein sequences and their diheadral angles have gotten from Alphafold predictions.

## Architecture structures
- [ ] Encoder only
- [ ] Embedding space (Prot Bert initially)
- [ ] Encoding
- [ ] Attention (single head, self, unmasked)
- [ ] Feed-forward neural network
- [ ] Add & Norm (?)
- [ ] Linearization

## Goals
- [ ] Interpretability
- [ ] Stable results
- [ ] Minimal

## Training
Data manipulation and processing.
The embedding space creation using tokenization can be done via the mapd project. (?) \
