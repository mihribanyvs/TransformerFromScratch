# Transformer From Scratch

## starting ideas
maybe we can start with a (örüntü) and it can try to grasp the idea behind the pattern

## Architecture structures
- [ ] Encoder decoder ?
- [ ] Embedding space
- [ ] Encoding
- [ ] Attention
- [ ] Feed-forward neural network (restricted boltzmann machine)
- [ ] Add & Norm (?)
- [ ] Linearization
- [ ] Softmax

## Architecture design

## 

## Goals
- [ ] Interpretability
- [ ] Stable results
- [ ] Minimal

## Training
The embedding space creation using tokenization can be done via the mapd project. (?) \
